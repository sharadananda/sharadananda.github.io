Sharadananda Mondal is an interdisciplinary researcher with interests at the intersection of economics, data science, and artificial intelligence. His work focuses on applying quantitative and computational methods to socio-economic analysis, public policy, and data-driven decision-making, with particular attention to real-world institutional contexts.

His research orientation emphasizes causal inference and responsible AI, aiming to move beyond prediction toward explanation, robustness, and policy relevance. Topics such as algorithmic bias, fairness, and the societal implications of AI systems are central to his ongoing academic and applied interests.

Highlighted Works
======
This GitHub profile is maintained as a research and learning space, hosting reproducible code, experiments, and exploratory projects in econometrics, machine learning, and applied AI. The repositories reflect a focus on clarity, documentation, and transparent workflows aligned with open science principles.

Current and planned work includes projects on causal machine learning, fairness in AI, credit risk analytics, and socio-economic data analysis. Emphasis is placed on connecting technical implementations with conceptual reasoning, clearly stated assumptions, and reproducible results.

Education
======
A Master’s degree in Economics has been completed, with formal training in econometrics, statistics, and multivariate analysis. Master’s research examined district-level food security in Uttar Pradesh, India, using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to construct composite indices from large socio-economic datasets.

Additional academic training includes a Post Graduate Diploma in Data Analytics with applied work in machine learning and financial risk modeling, and a Post Graduate Diploma in Systems Analysis from the National University of Singapore, providing a strong foundation in software engineering and systems thinking.
